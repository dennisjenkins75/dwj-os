Incomplete 32-bit protected mode kernel experiment.

In 2007 I decided to tinker with writing an OS kernel.  There are a lot of excellent resources online:
1. http://www.faqs.org/faqs/assembly-language/x86/general/part1/
1. http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles
1. http://www.osdev.org

Implemented:
1. Virtual memory.
1. Kernel heap.
1. Kernel threads.
1. Console debugging (not a formal driver).
