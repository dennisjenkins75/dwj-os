This is how I plan to help the kernel dump its own stack symbolically:

1) GNU Linker produces a map file (tmp/kernel.map).

2) Perl script converts map file into C header file (tmp/map_temp.inc)

3) C code (tools/makemap.c) includes this header.  Produces a binary
   that runs on the host platform.

4) This binary dumps processes the array from the map_temp.inc file into
   a compact binary table and stores it in a disk file on the host.

5) This table is included in the boot image and loaded as a module via grub.

6) Setup code will locate this module and map it into virtual address space
   in the running kernel.

7) Stack dump routine in the kernel can use the data table to resolve virtual
   addresses into symbolc names.
